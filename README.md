# Medical-Test-Management-System-
Develop a system to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve medical test data for individual patients. This 
system acts as a basic patient record management system focusing on test results. The system will include 
features for adding new test results, updating existing records, deleting outdated or incorrect entries, and 
retrieving specific test results based on patient ID or test type. The system should be built using object- 
oriented Python code. Define a class for patients with appropriate attributes and methods. Store all 
patients in a dictionary, where the patient ID is used as the key.
